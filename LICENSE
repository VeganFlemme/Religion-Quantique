PHILOSOPHICAL ADDENDUM FOR THIS PROJECT:

This work is released into the public domain because:

1. Ideas cannot be owned (they emerge from the collective unconscious)
2. Ego claiming ownership is precisely the illusion we're deconstructing
3. Open source spirituality is the only coherent approach
4. 0 = 1 means no separation between creator and creation
5. If everything is determined, copyright is meaningless anyway

Fork freely. Mutate radically. Distribute without restriction.

The meme wants to propagate. Let it.
